    "To understand Neo4j you need some intuition to graph theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph theory is the study of graphs (usually called networks in our domain). Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations (edges) between object(nodes). A graph can be either undirected (symetrical relation) or directed (asymetrical realtion). An edge connects only two nodes (It can be twice the same node). Here's an example of a graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/network.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A network can be represented in the three following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjacency matrix\n",
    "A network can be represented as an adjacency matrix. The row names and col names of this matrix is the names of the node. The cells are the relation between nodes. This matrix is symetric if the network is undirected. If directed the rows are the starting point of the edge (also called \"source\") and the columns are the end (\"target\"). Here's the adjacency matrix for the previous network:\n",

    "\n",
    "An edge list is composed of three columns: A source, a target and a weight. In others words we focus on the edge instead of the node. A source is the node from which the edge is going out and the target the node where the edge comes in. Here's the edge list of the previous network:\n",

    "Works pretty well but it is pretty slow. To overcome this problem you can use Cypher queries. Cypher is Neo4jâ€™s graph query language and is way faster than the py2neo wrapper. Cypher is, like SQL, a declarative, textual query language, but for graphs. If you have a small project you can ignore Cypher queries but if you are indeed interested by neo4j I really recommend to learn Cypher queries. We will learn CRUD operation with Cypher queries. https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/current/."
