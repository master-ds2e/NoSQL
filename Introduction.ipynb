    "NoSQL stands for \"Not only SQL\", every database that does not use SQL(Structured Query Language) is called NoSQL even though every NoSQL DB does not work the same way. The difference between SQL and NoSQL databases is really just a comparison of relational vs. non-relational databases. Deciding when to use SQL vs. NoSQL depends on the kind of information you’re storing and the best way to store it. Both types store data, they just store data differently.\n",
