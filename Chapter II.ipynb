    "- Persistent storage: \"a system that outlives (persists more than) the process that created it\" wikipedia. You create a Python object, say a list or a dict, when you close the Python session you lose this object. In other words it's not persistent. Before closing it you save this item as a pickle or .txt file: it becomes persistent. \n",
    "- CRUD: Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) are the most basic operations you can perform on persistent storage. For example in a txt file you can append new observations, read already existing ones but also update and delete specific row (last two operation are a bit tedious in a simple .txt file but effortles on DBs)\n",
    "- Database transaction: Sum of operations done in one go, the bank example is often used. First you debit an account (1st operation) then you credit the other account (2nd operation). The whole is a transaction.\n",

    "- ACID: \n",
    "    - Atomicity, either every operations in the transaction is complete or none. \n",
    "    - Consistency, DBs live on a set of rules (Primary Key, Constraints,...). At the end of the transactions theses rules are still respected\n",
