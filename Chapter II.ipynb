    "## Structured vs Unstructured vs Semi-structured.\n",

    "Lot of disagrement around what exactly is structured and semi-structured data. So here's my two cents\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Data:\n",
    "- Row and column format (or can be easily converted to row and column)\n",
    "- Fixed length/width\n",
    "- Missing values = Blank\n",
    "- Storing tools: CSV, XLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-Structured or Unstructured Data:\n",
    "- Contains tags, keys or other markers but follow no fixed structure.\n",
    "- Nested or hierarchical data.\n",
    "- Avoid messy translations into a relational data mode.\n",
    "- storing tools: JSON, XML, HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured Data is an abuse of language. Every data is structured in some way or your computer would not be able to understand it. Data is atleast semi-structured. Information in the other hand... An image has structured date (pixel by pixel, author, date, type,...) but the information present on an image is unstructured (The computer does not understand that on the image there's a \"red car\", as an observer you structure this information by gathering the pixel and the information becomes structured)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are the main sources of semi-structured data. Hence emails, logs, words document, ... are all considered unstructured-data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To have a persistant storage of text you can use a .txt file, logs, ... "

Full format descriptions are available at nodc.noaa.gov/.\\n\\nThe Oceanographic Station Data format contains physical-chemical oceanographic data recorded at discrete depth levels. Most of the observations were made using multi-bottle Nansen casts or other types of water samplers. A small amount (about 5 percent) were obtained using electronic CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) or STD (salinity- temperature-depth) recorders. The CTD/STD data were reported to NODC at depth levels equivalent to Nansen cast data, however, and have been processed and stored the same as the Nansen data.

The principal measured parameters and temperature and salinity , but dissolved oxygen, phosphate, total phosphorus, silicate, nitrate, nitrite, and pH may be reported. Meteorological conditions at the time of the cast (e.g., air temperature and pressure, wind, waves) may also be reported, as well as auxiliary data such as water color (Forel-Ule scale), water transparency (Secchi disk depth), and depth to bottom. Values of density (sigma-t) sound velocity, and dynamic depth anomaly are computed from measured parameters.

      "        <p>Sichuan Province in China is one of the world’s most earthquake-stricken areas. Wenchuan and Lushan Counties in Sichuan and other earthquake-stricken areas contain rural settlements subject to geological disasters and poverty. However, there is little research on the characteristics of disaster-preparedness behavior and whether these differ between professionals and the general public in rural settlements with high earthquake risk and poverty. Using survey data from 327 farmers in rural settlements affected by major earthquakes in Wenchuan and Lushan Counties, independent-sample t-tests and chi-squared tests were used to test for differences in the disaster-preparedness behaviors of professionals and the general public. The results show that (1) there were significant differences in emergency-disaster preparedness, knowledge and skills preparedness and overall disaster-prevention preparedness, and (2) there was no significant difference in physical disaster-prevention preparation. Based on these results, the study suggests policy directions for regional poverty alleviation, disaster prevention and reduction and disaster management.</p>\n",

      "      <p>The primary task of the rural-revitalization strategy of the 19th National Congress of the People’s Republic of China (CPC) is to alleviate poverty and achieve prosperity for the poor by 2020 [<xref rid=\"B1-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>,<xref rid=\"B2-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>,<xref rid=\"B3-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>,<xref rid=\"B4-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>,<xref rid=\"B5-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>,<xref rid=\"B6-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>,<xref rid=\"B7-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>,<xref rid=\"B8-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>]. The 2019 central government document No. 1, “Prioritizing the development of agriculture and rural areas, and assisting agriculture, rural areas and farmers”, clearly states that in order to promote rural development in a down-to-earth manner, it is necessary to speed up the completion of rural human settlements and public services [<xref rid=\"B9-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>,<xref rid=\"B10-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>,<xref rid=\"B11-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, China has made remarkable achievements in poverty alleviation [<xref rid=\"B12-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>]. The number of poor people in rural areas has decreased from 98.99 million to 17.13 million from 2012 to 2018—an average of nearly 14 million per year. However, by the end of 2018, there were still more than 17 million people living in poverty in rural areas—mainly in 14 contiguous impoverished mountainous areas [<xref rid=\"B13-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>,<xref rid=\"B14-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. Due to geology, topography and the level of local economic development, some settlements in these areas have a relationship between geological disasters and poverty [<xref rid=\"B15-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>,<xref rid=\"B16-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>]. Sichuan is a world-famous major earthquake area and is China’s most serious earthquake disaster province [<xref rid=\"B3-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>,<xref rid=\"B4-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. From 2000 to 2017, 179 earthquakes of magnitude five or above occurred in China, resulting in a total of 488,437 casualties, of which 94.17% were in Sichuan Province. The direct economic losses from earthquake disasters in China amounted to 1133.4 billion Yuan, of which 938.7 billion Yuan or 82.82%, was in Sichuan Province [<xref rid=\"B17-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. The Wenchuan earthquake and Lushan earthquake are two major earthquakes with a magnitude of more than seven that caused about 450,000 casualties and direct economic losses of more than 900 billion Yuan [<xref rid=\"B18-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>,<xref rid=\"B19-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. Due to geological disasters and extreme weather conditions, poverty-prone populations in some Western mountain areas have returned to poverty at an average rate of 15–25%—or as high as 30–50% in some places [<xref rid=\"B20-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>,<xref rid=\"B21-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>]. Unlike the poverty effects caused by an extreme climate, geological disasters have the characteristics of occurring suddenly and being highly destructive [<xref rid=\"B22-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>,<xref rid=\"B23-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. The life savings of farmers can be wiped out instantly by such disasters, which have become a major way that farmers enter poverty or return to it after being previously lifted out of it [<xref rid=\"B24-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>,<xref rid=\"B25-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>]. Therefore, in the context of the “affluent life” proposed in the “rural revitalization strategy”, and to achieve the goal of have a prosperous poor population by 2020, it is necessary to carry out research on the large group of farmers that live in regions prone to geological disasters and poverty.</p>\n",
      "      <p>When dealing with earthquake disasters in high-risk earthquake areas, adequate disaster-avoidance preparation can reduce the threats to life and property loss and, thus, reduce the likelihood that farmers will return to poverty [<xref rid=\"B26-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>,<xref rid=\"B27-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>,<xref rid=\"B28-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>,<xref rid=\"B29-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>]. Many empirical studies have shown that residents’ disaster preparedness is an effective means to deal with disaster shocks [<xref rid=\"B30-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>,<xref rid=\"B31-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>,<xref rid=\"B32-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>,<xref rid=\"B33-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>,<xref rid=\"B34-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>,<xref rid=\"B35-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>]. Disaster preparedness refers to the measures taken by residents to avoid disasters [<xref rid=\"B36-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>,<xref rid=\"B37-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">37</xref>,<xref rid=\"B38-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. Different studies have different entry points for the measurement of residents’ preparedness to avoid disasters [<xref rid=\"B39-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>,<xref rid=\"B40-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>,<xref rid=\"B41-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>,<xref rid=\"B42-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref>]. Existing research has focused on protecting residents’ life safety by measuring their disaster preparedness (e.g., [<xref rid=\"B32-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>,<xref rid=\"B33-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>,<xref rid=\"B34-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]). Some scholars think that residents’ preparedness for avoiding disasters is a one-dimensional concept, which can be directly measured by asking residents whether they have made adequate preparedness for avoiding disasters (e.g., [<xref rid=\"B43-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref>]). Some scholars think that residents’ preparedness for disaster avoidance is a multi-dimensional concept, which can be measured from multiple dimensions. For example, Onuma et al. [<xref rid=\"B44-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>] divided residents’ preparedness for avoiding disasters into three dimensions of basic preparedness, energy/heat preparedness and assessment of specific design indicators for each dimension. At the same time, many studies believe that the residents’ preparedness for avoiding disasters is simply material preparation, which is measured from the perspective of residents’ material preparation. Among them, the most common way to measure disaster preparedness is to ask residents whether they have prepared emergency disaster kits (flashlights, radios, clean water) (e.g., [<xref rid=\"B35-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>,<xref rid=\"B36-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>,<xref rid=\"B45-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>,<xref rid=\"B46-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>]), buy insurance (e.g., [<xref rid=\"B24-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>,<xref rid=\"B25-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>]), if they had an escape plan (e.g., [<xref rid=\"B39-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>,<xref rid=\"B40-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>,<xref rid=\"B41-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>,<xref rid=\"B42-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref>,<xref rid=\"B47-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref>,<xref rid=\"B48-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref>]) and reinforce houses (e.g., [<xref rid=\"B38-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>,<xref rid=\"B49-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref>]). In addition, some scholars have noted that in addition to material preparation, residents’ disaster preparedness, conscious disaster risk management behavior is also an effective means to deal with disaster impact (e.g., [<xref rid=\"B21-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>]). In general, the existing research provides useful reference for the measurement of disaster preparedness in this study. however, few research systems comprehensively consider three dimensions of emergency disaster preparedness, knowledge and skills preparedness and physical disaster prevention and set indicators to conduct systematic measurement of residents’ behavior of disaster preparedness. In the face of an earthquake disaster, a family’s disaster preparedness (such as preparing an emergency box) can increase their safety to some extent, but assistance for the reconstruction of their family life is limited. Determining the best way to construct a complete, efficient and resilient disaster prevention and control system that makes up for the shortcomings of current systems is of great significance to rural revitalization. It is a topic of high relevance to residents and governments of disaster areas and to society in general. Therefore, compared with the existing research, one of the marginal contributions of this research is to integrate the dimensions of residents’ preparedness for earthquake disaster and measure it with specific indicators.</p>\n",
      "      <p>To date, a large number of studies have focused on earthquake disasters and to explore their disaster-preparedness behaviors and their influences (e.g., [<xref rid=\"B40-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>,<xref rid=\"B41-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>,<xref rid=\"B50-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">50</xref>]). According to the general logic, if a region is well prepared for disaster, there should be no significant difference in preparedness between general public and professionals [<xref rid=\"B42-ijerph-17-05254\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref>]. However, judging from the reality of disaster threat zones around the world, professionals tend to be better prepared than the general public. Identify the significant difference in disaster preparedness between professionals and the general public has two benefits, on one hand, it is helpful to identify the shortcomings of disaster preparedness of general public and formulate relevant policies to improve their disaster prevention and reduction capacity; on the other hand, we can find out the deficiencies in disaster preparedness of professionals and formulate corresponding policies to improve regional disaster prevention and reduction capacity. However, few studies have further analyzed the characteristics and differences of disaster preparedness between professionals and the general public. Professionals are generally full-time village cadres who have been systematically trained by professional institutions such as the state land administration (In China, the Land and Resources Administration of The People’s Republic of China will organize professionals to participate in the training program of mass monitoring and mass prevention systems, systematically introduce experience in disaster prevention and reduction, and conduct some on-site disaster risk management exercises, so that professionals can better guide the general public in disaster risk management), and have the ability to protect their own lives and property, as well as the professional ability to observe the signs of earthquakes and warn the general public in a timely manner. The general public are local farmers in high-risk areas who do not have sufficient disaster awareness and preparedness. Compared with other studies, the second marginal contribution of this study is that the research objects are divided into professionals and general public, and the characteristics and differences of disaster preparedness of the two groups are systematically analyzed. Based on this, the objective of this study is to analyze the characteristics and differences of disaster preparedness between professionals and general public through the survey data of farmers in China’s earthquake-stricken areas, so as to provide references for the formulation of regional disaster prevention and reduction policies.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Under the above background, this study focuses on the characteristics and differences of disaster preparedness between general public and professionals, in order to provide a reference for the formulation of policies related to poverty alleviation and disaster risk management of rural households in areas where earthquake disaster and poverty are intertwined. There are two key problems to be solved in this study:</p>\n",

The research method was one-on-one face-to-face interviews, which mainly focused on residents’ disaster risk perceptions and behavior choice of disaster preparedness. Each interview lasted about 1.5 h.

Some 59% of professionals kept important items in a safe place (4% less than the general population), probably due to the general high awareness of property protection among farmers.</p>\n",

Specifically, 56% of professionals had emergency supplies, which is 35% higher than the general public; 94% of professionals had taken preventive measures, which is 21% higher than the general public. However, only 27% of the general public had taken out natural disaster insurance, which is almost the same rate as for professionals. This may be due to a low awareness of disaster risk among local farmers and the low amount of insurance coverage offered, which results in low enthusiasm to take out insurance.</p>\n",

Specifically, 85% of professionals participated in disaster prevention skills training (44% more than the general public); and 88% of professionals participated in escape drills organized by the village (36% more than the general public). The proportion of professionals with access to knowledge was 97%, while that of the general public was 88%. The difference was not significant, possibly because the survey sites were all in the main earthquake area or area of influence, and the local village committee provided sufficient access to earthquake disaster knowledge to ensure that most people could access relevant knowledge.</p>\n",

      "      <title>5. Policy Implications</title>\n",
      "      <p>The disaster and poverty situation in Sichuan Province is quite severe and many large earthquakes have occurred, which has aroused wide public concern. This is also one of the most important challenges in poverty alleviation in the southwestern mountainous areas. Therefore, earthquake-related disaster prevention and mitigation work is particularly important, even though most earthquake-prone areas are equipped with relevant professionals. However, there is a significant difference between professionals and the general public in disaster-preparedness behavior. Based on the above conclusions, the following countermeasures and suggestions are proposed for disaster prevention and reduction by farmers in areas where earthquakes and poverty are interwoven.</p>\n",
      "      <p>(1) Professionals should strengthen their awareness of insurance participation and disaster crises. Professionals have rich knowledge reserves for the cognition and perception of earthquake disasters and have relevant scientific literacy that helps in the understanding of disaster-avoidance articles, escape behavior and reducing loss of life and property after disasters. However, they have some shortcomings in their awareness and purchasing of natural disaster insurance, reinforcement of houses and placement of important items. The government could start by raising the awareness of insurance professionals themselves and general awareness of disaster crises. This could be strengthened by advising insurance companies to increase their types and amounts of natural disaster insurance offered, increase the publicity of natural disaster insurance, and increase subsidies for insurance and house reinforcement.</p>\n",
      "      <p>(2) The general public should increase their initiatives in disaster prevention and preparedness. There are significant differences between the emergency-disaster preparedness and the knowledge and skills preparedness of the general public in the face of disasters, especially in the following five aspects: emergency supplies preparedness, preparedness for preventive measures, self-study and participation in training and escape drills. The difference between the two groups in these five aspects is, in the final analysis, the difference between a subjective initiative in disaster preparedness and a sense of disaster avoidance. The government may consider promoting the initiative of the general public to avoid disasters. This can be done by promoting education on disaster prevention, establishing grassroots disaster prevention groups and establishing village disaster-prevention preparedness and supervision committees.</p>\n",
      "      <p>(3) The government’s disaster prevention policy-making should expand its audience appropriately. The government formulates disaster prevention policies and measures and systematically trains full-time village cadres as professionals for the ultimate purpose of ensuring that there is no significant difference between professionals and the general public in all aspects of disaster prevention and reduction. However,—according to the research results—the overall difference between the two groups is still significant, indicating that the range of people reached by existing policies and measures is small. In future policy formulation, the audience should be expanded appropriately to make up for the shortcomings of the general public in disaster prevention and mitigation, so as to eliminate the significant difference between the two groups.</p>\n",
      "      <p>(4) The system of settlement disaster prevention and reduction should be improved. The government can jointly build a disaster prevention and mitigation system for settlements based on the three aspects of emergency-disaster preparedness, knowledge and skills preparedness and physical disaster prevention. It should give full play to the leading and exemplary role of professionals in emergency-disaster preparedness and knowledge and skills preparedness, actively organize knowledge-based training on natural disasters such as earthquakes, organize regular earthquake escape drills, regularly inspect the soundness of houses prepared by farmers for disaster mitigation, and give special disaster-prevention guidance to poor farmers. We will appropriately increase subsidies for settlement in mountainous areas, improve farmers’ production conditions and transportation environment; strengthen farmers’ own capacity to consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation.</p>\n",

    "- Database management system (DBMS) is responsible for tasks such as data integrity, security, backup and recovery, performance tuning, and query optimization\n",
    "- Persistent storage: \"a system that outlives (persists more than) the process that created it\" wikipedia. You create a Python object, say a list or a dict, when you close the Python session you lose this object. In other words it's not persistent. Before closing it you save this item as a pickle or .txt file: it becomes persistent. \n",
    "- CRUD: Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) are the most basic operations you can perform on persistent storage. For example in a txt file you can append new observations, read already existing ones but also update and delete specific row (last two operation are a bit tedious in a simple .txt file but effortless on DBs)\n",
    "- Database transaction: Sum of operations done in one go, the bank example is often used. First you debit an account (1st operation) then you credit the other account (2nd operation). The whole is a transaction.\n",
    "- Distributed data store: Data are stored on different node (computers if you want), if one node is down you can still access your data on other nodes (You usually put Replica Sets on different nodes)\n",
    "- ACID: \n",
    "    - Atomicity, either every operations in the transaction is complete or none. \n",
    "    - Consistency, DBs live on a set of rules (Primary Key, Constraints,...). At the end of the transactions theses rules are still respected\n",
    "    - Isolation, in the context of concurrent transaction the result is the same as sequential transactions.\n",
